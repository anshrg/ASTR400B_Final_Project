# ASTR400B_Final_Project
Final project for ASTR 400B - Theoretical Astrophysics (University of Arizona) 

The topic of this research project is to determine the eventual fate of Stars like the Sun in the disk of M31 and M33. Here, Sun-like stars are defined to be those at a similar distance from the galactic center (~8 pc), with a circular speed calculated using the enclosed mass at that radius, and with some maximum velocity out of the galactic plane. I determine where these stars end up relative to the merger remnant and visualize this using a movie of the simulation. Additionally, I examine the distance of Sun-like particles in M31 from the M31 center of mass over time. To do this, I create histograms which display the number of particles at a range of distances over time using all snaps from the simulation. These histograms are stitched together into a second video. Furthermore, I make a plot showing the maximum, minimum, and median velocity of Sun-like particles from the M31 COM as a function of simulation time.
